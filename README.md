# MSc_thesis
Code used for MSc thesis 

MSc_equation.py contains all the functions used, prerequisite files for MSc_equation.py are CMOD5.N.py and CMOD_IFR2.py

MSc.py loads the radar data, applies MSc_equations and prints/plots results 

CMOD5.N.py and CMOD_IFR2.py contain code for running GMF's (could be added straight to MSc_equation.py in later installments)
